In this video I'm explaining one particular aspect of the Gaussian distribution
(aka the normal distribution),
namely the scaling factor.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[2-0]
I assume you know the probability density function of the Gaussian distribution.

Here I am using the function "exp" to denote the exponential function.
Programmers will be used to this notation.
Mathematicians are more used to write this as a power with the base "e".

[e^: on]
But I find this a bit hard to read.
And by the way, by default TeX typesets this even smaller.

[small exp: on]
So let's switch back to the function-call notation,
as we anyway do not care about the Euler constant itself.

[e^: off]
The density function has two parameters μ and σ to tweak the distribution:
- μ denotes the mean and
- σ denotes the standard deviation.

[2-1]
As for any probability density function
the integral over our function's domain must be 1.
This is because it is 100% certain that an experiment
will produce **some** value in the domain.

In the case of the Gaussian distribution the domain is the set of real numbers.
So we have to integrate from negative infinity to positive infinity.

[2-2]
So let us vary the parameters a bit to see their impact on the distribution.

[2-3][2-4][2-5]
If we vary the mean μ,
this moves the bell curve to the left or to the right.
But it has no impact on the integral.

[2-6][2-7][2-8][2-9]
If we vary the standard deviation σ,
this stretches or squeezes the bell curve horizontally.
To ensure that the integral does not change, the height of the bell curve
must be adapted.
- When the bell curve gets wider, it also has to get lower in the middle.
- And when it gets lower, it has to get higher in the middle.

While the occurrence of σ as the denominator of x-μ is responsible for the
horizontal scaling,
the other occurrence in the outer scaling factor takes care of the vertical
scaling.

[2-10]
Let's see what would happen without the scaling factor.

The integral would become σ*sqrt(2\pi).
With our current value of σ this would become about 0.752.

[2-11][2-12][2-13]
But now the integral value depends on the selected value of σ.

[2-14]
That's why we have the σ in the scaling factor.

Now we have understood the impact of μ and σ:
- μ has no impact on the integral.
- The "horizontal" impact of the right occurrence of σ
  must be compensated "vertically" by the left occurrence.
So let us get rid of the parameters now
to concentrate on more interesting things.
[2-15]
Actually we set μ and σ to standard values 0 and 1.
This allows us to eliminate them from the formula.

The yellow curve represents the "standard" normal distribution.
And of course its integral must be 1 again.

This is ensured by the remaining scaling factor.

[2-16]
If we omit this scaling factor, the integral grows to
√(2π)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[3-0]
At least we would expect this
because we have learned that we need the scaling factor.

[3-1]
But why does this hold?

[3-2]
And where does the π come from?

This is the main question I want to answer in this video.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[4]
You might want to treat this video as in a quiz show.

I give you more and more hints about the solution.

Once you think you can solve it on your own,
you hit the buzzer.
[buzz]

Well, actually you stop the video.
Then you have as much time as you need to solve the problem.

If you want, you can report the video timestamp from which you solved it
in the comments.

If you could not yet come up with a solution,
continue the video and try again later.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[5-0]
A short digression: π does show up in mathematics in unexpected places.
Let me give you two examples.

[5-1]
The series consisting of
- the inverses of
- the odd numbers
- with alternating signs
adds up to π/4.

Actually this appearance of π was not really unexpected
because the series was developed during the investigation of trigonometric
functions.

With today's terminology we would say that
the series is the taylor expansion at x = 0 of the inverse tangent function
and then evaluated at x = 1.
And the inverse tangent of 1 is 45°, or in radians: π/4

[5-2]
In the second example the appearance of π was perhaps more surprising.

The series consists of
- the inverses of
- the square numbers.

This series had been investigated by several mathematicians
before it was solved.

It is known as the "Basel problem" because several mathematicians from
the Swiss city of Basel have worked on it.
In particular
- two members of the Bernoulli family and
- Leonhard Euler
who finally solved it.
This result made Euler famous.

There are several videos on YouTube
explaining different derivations of the result.
So I will not go into more detail here.

Admittedly the only similarity to **our** problem is probably
that π shows up in a problem
that looks unrelated to circles on first sight.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[6-0]
So now let us return to our integral.

BTW, I am not sure who is to credit for this solution.
Where I searched, most frequently Laplace was mentioned,
but also Poisson and Gauß.

We give the integral the name **I** so we can refer to it more easily.

[6-1]
We are in the lucky position that we already know the value of I.
We only need to find a derivation, not the value itself.

[6-2]
The square root gives us a first hint.
It is often a good idea to get rid of roots to simplify things.
[6-3]
So we square our equation.

[6-4]
Now we use the definition of I.
[6-5]

[6-6]
We write the square as a product.
[6-7]

[6-8]
The two integrals are independent from each other.
So we can use different names for the integration variables.
Let us rename the integration variable in the right factor.
[6-9]

[6-10]
The left factor is now just a constant
from the point of view of the right integral.
(It does not depend on y.)
So we can pull it into the right integral.
[6-11]

[6-12]
Similarly the right exponential expression does not depend on x
and can thus be pulled into the x integral.
[6-13]

[6-14]
Now we use the basic property of the exponential function:
A **product** of exponentials can be rewritten
as a single exponential function applied to the **sum** of the former
exponents.
[6-15]

[6-16]
We simplify this by pulling the factor "-1/2" out.
[6-17]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[7-0]
Let us have a look at this function depending on x and y.

We want to compute the volume under the function surface.

[7-1]
The volume consists of infinitesimal elements like this one.

The element has infinitesimal lengths in the x and y direction.
(This is the yellow dx and the magenta dy.)

The height is just the function value for the respective values of x and y.

[7-2]
In the previous slide we have summed up these elements along the x axis

[7-3]
and then along the y axis.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[6-17]
This is the formula that we have reached.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[7-4]
The blue lines are those lines on the surface
that have constant x or y values, respectively.

[7-5]
And here are the lines on the surface
with a constant function value (or constant z value).
[tilt the scene]
And these are circles.

Actually the subexpression (x^2 + y^2) is one side of a circle equation.
Or one side of Pythagoras` theorem.
Or a subexpression of the Euclidian norm.

This suggests to replace (x^2 + y^2) with just r^2
where r is the radius of one of these circles.

We can deal with this most easily in a polar coordinate system
(or a cylindric one if we also count the z axis).
[7-6][7-7][7-8][7-9]

The function now depends on the radius.
It actually does not depend on the angle ϕ.

[7-10]
An infinitesimal element has the function value as its height
as before.
It is just expressed slightly differently.

The size in the radial direction is just dr.

In the tangential direction things become slightly more complicated.
If we take an infinitesimal angle dϕ,
the tangential size of the element is not just dϕ,
but r*dϕ.

This ensures that the tangential size becomes 
[7-11] larger
or
[7-12] smaller 
on larger and smaller circles.
[7-13]

Now we can integrate
[7-14] in the tangential or angular direction from 0 to 2π
and finally
[7-15] in the radial direction from 0 to ∞.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[6-18]
So let's apply and use the transformation in our integral computation.
[6-19]

[6-20]
The integrand does not depend on ϕ.
So we can pull it out of the inner integral for ϕ.
[6-21]

[6-22]
And the remaining integrand in the integral for ϕ is just 1.
This makes the integral trivial.
It can be solved to 2π.
[6-23]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[7-16][7-17][7-18][7-19]
We could also treat our integration
as the task to integrate the areas of all these cylinders.
(Actually just the cylinder sides, not the caps and floors!)

The cylinder area is the product of the circumference with the height.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[6-23]
And exactly this product occurs as the integrand of our current formula.

[6-24]
Pull the constant term 2π out.
[6-25]

[6-26]
Now we are lucky.
Our integrand happens to be the derivative of some elementary expression.
This can be seen easily by deriving -exp(-1/2 r^2) using the chain rule.

(Notice that without the extra factor "r"
the exponential expression does not have an antiderivative.
This is why we went all the way to the 2-variable integration
and the polar coordinates.)

[6-27]
Now we apply the antiderivative...
[6-28]

[6-29]
...evaluate it at the borders...
[6-30]

[6-31]
...simplify...
[6-32]

[6-31]
...take the square root on both sides again...
[6-32]

[6-33]
Et voila, the result we were looking for.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[7-21][7-22]
A side note:
I have even found articles on the web suggesting to integrate disks like these
along the z axis.

But this approach was meant as a training exercise in integration.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[8-0]
Let us briefly recap the most important steps of our derivation.

[8-1]
The first trick was to use the square of the integral
and to convert this into an integral over 2 variables

[8-2]
The second trick was to rewrite the integrand
to a formula involving (x^2 + y^2).
And this can be replaced with r^2 using the circle equation
(or Pythagoras or the Euklidian norm --  in a way it is all the same).

[8-2]
The third trick (or lucky coincidence) was that
"exp(-1/2 r^2) r" (with the extra r!) has an antiderivative.

So we have a quite typical situation:
A proof is relatively easy to understand once it exists,
but it is not trivial to find.
And it was even more difficult at times
when the result (√(2π)) was not yet known.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[9]
Now that we have understood the scaling factor in front of the exponential
function,
we may ask for the reason for the other scaling factor:
The factor 1/2 inside the exponential function.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[10-0]
I am deriving a result about the variance of the standard normal distribution
in several steps.
This result will help understanding why have this other scaling factor.

[10-1]
As usual, we denote the probability distribution function of the standard
normal distribution as "φ".

[10-2]
Now let's find the derivative φ'.

[10-3]
The constant factor and the exponential function remain unchanged from φ,
but we have to apply the chain rule twice:
- for the factor inside the exponential function
- for the squaring of x

[10-4]
We rewrite the first part of the expression as φ(x).
=> [10-5]

[10-6]
The factors of 1/2 and 2 cancel each other out.
=> [10-7]

[10-8]
And let's pull the factor -x to the beginning of the expression.
=> [10-9]

[10-10]
Now derive this another time.

[10-11]
We keep the minus sign and apply the product rule to the rest:
- derive the first factor and keep the second
  plus
- keep the first factor and derive the second

[10-12]
Eliminate the 1
=> [10-13]

[10-14]
Use our previous formula for φ'
=> [10-15]

[10-16]
Simplify the minus signs
=> [10-17]

[10-18]
Join the xs
=> [10-19]

[10-20]
Pull out φ(x)
=> [10-21]

Why is this greyed out?
This result is correct, but it is not really what we need.

[10-22]
So we go back to the previous formula.

[10-23]
We are actually interested in the second term here.

[10-24] (Skip over this step.)

[10-25]
So here is the formula for that term x^2 φ(x).

[10-26]
As I said earlier,
we are interested in the variance of our probability distribution function.

[10-27]
And generally the variance of a PDF is defined as this integral.

[10-28]
In general we have to subtract the mean μ from x
to ensure that the distribution is balanced around 0.
But in our case this is not necessary
as our distribution is already balanced.
=> [10-29]

[10-30]
Now the integrand is exactly the term
from the left-hand-side in the previous line.
We replace it by the right-hand side.
=> [10-31]

[10-32]
Now we split the integral over a sum into a sum of integrals.
=> [10-33]

[10-34]
The second integral is just the integral over the entire domain of the PDF.
And, as we have seen earlier, the PDF was normalized
so that this integral evaluates to 1.
=> [10-35]

[10-36]
Now for the first integral.
The nice thing here is that the integrand is a derivative we already know.
The antiderivative of φ'' is just φ'.
We simply apply that function at both ends of the integration interval
and subtract the values.

[10-37]
You might be familiar with this notation for expressing that.

[10-38]
φ is 0 for both negative and positive infinity.

[10-39]
So here is the trivial difference.

[10-40]
And finally let's simplify that term
=> [10-41]
to 1.

And the standard deviation,
which is just the square root of the variance,
is also 1.

Setting the variance (or standard deviation) to 1
is the second step of "standardization" of the Gaussian distribution.
(The first step was to set the mean to 0.)

If we had *not* started with the inner scaling factor of 1/2
at the top of the page,
we would not have arrived at a variance of 1.

(I leave it to you to adapt the derivations.)

So this explains why we have this inner scaling factor of 1/2.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[11-0]
Finally a note about the technologies used in this presentation.

I must admit that trying out some technologies
was my actual motivation for creating this presentation.

If it were just about the scaling factors,
there are already several presentations around.
In particular there is a video by 3blue1brown on this topic,
which came out at a time when I had this presentation almost complete.

I wanted to know if web technologies are sufficient to produce animations
similar to those generated with, say, the Python-based "manim" library.

While my presentation would still need some polishing to reach that quality,
I am convinced now that there is no deep obstacle
to getting on a par with manim using web technologies.

And my web-based approach has additional advantages:
1. I can interact with the slides.
   For example:
   - I can step back for answering questions from the audience.
   - And I can switch between notations:
     - between π and τ
     - or between exp(x) and e^x.
2. I can easily publish the slides for you to play around with.


[11-1]
So what have I used?
- TypeScript, React, and Vite are meanwhile pretty standard choices.

[11-2]
- three.js provides a relatively comfortable JavaScript API
  for 3D graphics running in the browser, using your graphics card.
- react-three-fiber makes this even more comfortable
  by integrating it with React.
- "drei" is a set of react-three-fiber components.

[11-3]
- I have used SVG for 2D graphics.

- In earlier versions of this presentation I have also used
  PixiJS and ReactPixi.
  These also gave a very good impression.

  However I consolidated on technologies
  because using Pixi and Three at the same time became confusing.
  They are quite similar but have different APIs.
  I frequently tried to use Pixi in the Three-way or Three in the Pixi-way.

- With the orthogonal camera, three.js is also an option for 2D graphics.
  That might be my choice for a future project.

- Plain canvas was a bit too low-level.

[11-4]
- For rendering TeX formulas I have chosen KaTeX over MathJax because it felt
  much more light-weight.
  I think MathJax is more appropriate for non-interactive documents.

- I preferred Matej Mazur's react integration over other existing integrations.
  But unfortunately I don't remember why.

[11-5]
- Leva provides the config boxes in the top-right corners of the slide.

  These are not only useful for interacting with the presentation
  while giving a talk.
  They were also very helpful while developing the presentation.
  In particular, they allowed me to go through the steps of a slide manually
  before I configured the sequence of steps.

[11-6]
- The slide-show navigation is home-grown.

  There are of course a lot of tools around,
  but I was not sure which one to pick.

  After all, it is not too complicated to implement this functionality.
  And it allowed me to integrate the stepping with the graphics and formulas.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
