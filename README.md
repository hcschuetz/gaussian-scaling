<h1>The Scaling Factor in the Gaussian Distribution</h1>

<p>
  This project had two goals:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      Explaining the scaling factor 1/sqrt(2Ï€) in the formula for the
      Gaussian distribution (also called "normal" distribution).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Experimenting with various web technologies, in particular
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          three.js and related tools for (dynamic) 3D graphics and
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          rendering (dynamic) TeX formulas in HTML
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      to see whether something like Manim
      (see <a href="https://github.com/3b1b/manim">here</a>
      and <a href="https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim">here</a>)
      could also be built on top of web technologies.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  Goal #1 actually became obsolete when 3Blue1Brown published
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy8r7WSuT1I">his video series</a>
  on that same topic when I was about to get my presentation completed.
</p>
<p>
  But I think goal #2 was achieved.
  While my web-based tools still have limited functionality
  and would benefit from some polishing,
  I see no major obstacles against getting on a par with Manim.
</p>
<p>
  The web-based approach has its own advantages:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Live interaction with the slides is possible.</li>
  <li>Slides can be published easily for the audience to play with.</li>
</ul>
